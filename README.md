This project aims to build a model that predicts the likelihood of default using cusumer finacial data.

## Objectives
- Perform EDA to understand the structure, distribution, and quality of the data.
- Build a predictive model to classify the likelihood of default
- Identify key drivers of credit risk
- Provide actionable insights for risk management teams.
